    "description": "<p>Veronica is the second princess of Britannia. The younger sibling of the first princess, Margaret, and elder to her adopted sister; the third princess, Elizabeth. She has a tomboyish appearance, short light colored hair and a slim build. She wears a stylish fur coat, a knight-styled attire, a belt and a pair of long boots.   She is described to be a tomboy, who, as a child, liked to and often used to play with swords with the boys, and would be scolded by her father for doing so. Sharing the Holy Knights' attitude about enslaving the citizens, she also cares about her younger sister, Elizabeth.</p>\n",
