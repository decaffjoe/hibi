    "description": "<p>Darry is a girl from Adai Village, who used to be cared for by Rossiu. She is Gimmy's twin sister and has a good bond with him. As a young girl, she was shy and quiet and used to cling to a plush doll, which she carried with her at all times. After the timeskip, however, she is much more confident and has left her old personality behind. As a Grapearl pilot, she is careful, calm and perceptive, and puts more thought and planning into her actions than Gimmy.  (Source: Wikipedia)</p>\n",
