    "description": "<p>Will A. Zeppeli was on a ship with a crew studying Aztec ruins when he was younger when his father put on the mask and killed everyone in the crew but his son. After this horrific event, Zeppeli travels the world in order to destroy the mask, and sees a man cure someone using the Ripple. Zeppeli is then directed to his master Tonpetty, who teaches him to use the Ripple. However, Tonpetty foresees Zeppeli's death during his training, warning him that should he complete his training he will surely die. Zeppeli doesn't share this fact until the fight with Tarkus, where he afterwards gives his power to Jonathan, whom he trained after the Joestar's house burns down. His grandson is Caesar Anthonio Zeppeli.</p>\n",
