    "description": "<p><strong>Birthday:</strong> December 28\n<strong>Age:</strong> 22 (first appearance), 23 (current)\n<strong>Height:</strong> 172 cm (5' 7¾&quot;)\n<strong>Occupation:</strong> Pro Hero (No.3 - former, No.2 - current)\n<strong>Quirk:</strong> Fierce Wings\n<strong>Affiliation:</strong> Hero Public Safety Commission, ~! Paranormal Liberation Front (as a spy) !~</p>\n<p>Hawks is carefree, jovial, and dislikes formalities, often acting in a spontaneous and unpredictable way while being cocky and taunting. He believes that popular approval is the most important metric a Pro Hero should be judged for, and does not appear to take the official rankings seriously, showing a preference for the lower ranks as it would allow him to act more freely and avoid the burdens of being a top hero. He states his wish to patrol in a leisurely fashion and &quot;take it easy.</p>\n<p>~! It is hinted that Hawks was a fan of Endeavor from an early age, as depicted by the drawing of him as a child holding an Endeavor figurine. !~</p>\n<p>(Source: Boku no Hero Academia Wiki)</p>\n",
