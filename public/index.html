He believes that popular approval is the most important metric a Pro Hero should be judged for, and does not appear to take the official rankings seriously, showing a preference for the lower ranks as it would allow him to act more freely and avoid the burdens of being a top hero. He states his wish to patrol in a leisurely fashion and &quot;take it easy.</p>\n<p><span class='spoiler' title='live dangerously'> It is hinted that Hawks was a fan of Endeavor from an early age, as depicted by the drawing of him as a child holding an Endeavor figurine. </span></p>\n<p>(Source: Boku no Hero Academia Wiki)</p>\n",
