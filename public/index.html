    "description": "<p>ACDC is one of the Pillar Men that were discovered by Nazis in Rome. Like Wham and Cars, ACDC is very confident in his powers and abilities and see humans as inferior. However, he has a more violent temper than the others to the point that he has to cry and sob to calm himself down.  He is named after Australian Hard rock band AC/DC.   <span class='spoiler' title='live dangerously'>ACDC uses &quot;the skill of fire&quot;. He raises his body temperature in order to heat his blood to 500°C. He then extends his blood vessels out of his body and makes them into long, prehensile needles with which he injects his hot blood into enemies, dissolving them from within. Even if the blood isn't injected directly, it can still eat through flesh and metal alike if sprayed on a target from the outside. AC/DC has been shown to have an extremely erratic temper, sobbing at the sight of his own severed arm, only to calm himself near-instantly and replace it with the arm of Loggins. He himself stated that he has a more explosive temper than either of his brethren, and claims to openly express any rage or sorrow he feels so he doesn't lose his self-control.  ACDC had traveled to ancient China and knew Sun Tzu's theory that &quot;all warfare is based on deception&quot;. In his battle with Joseph Joestar, he tries to intimidate him by disabling Joseph's deceptive tactics.  ACDC cuts the hidden rope through which Joseph plans to send Ripple energy to hurt him. Nevertheless, he falls for Joseph's more sophisticated deception, for Joseph has predicted his action and employed the cut-and-restore rope trick on the rope.  His bones and muscles are destroyed, but his brain and blood vessels possess Suzi Q, who takes the Red Stone of Aja and sends it to Cars in Switzerland. ACDC then prepares to turn Suzi Q into a &quot;blood bomb&quot;, planning on pressurizing his boiling blood until her body bursts, killing himself and Joseph's group in the process. Joseph and Caesar attack Suzi Q at the same time. While their Ripples cancel each other out and keep Suzi Q unharmed, ACDC is destroyed.</span> (Source: Wikipedia)</p>\n",
