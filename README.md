# Hibi 日々

[Live website](https://hibi.fun)

A website and twitter bot ([@hibianime](https://twitter.com/hibianime)) that post a pseudo-random anime character every day!

Note: the twitter bot files are in the [twitter-bot branch](https://gitlab.com/spongechameleon/hibi/-/tree/twitter-bot)

## Project direction

No immediate work is being done on the project.

Right now: (a) I am content with the functionality of both the website and bot as they currently stand and (b) am not sure exactly what more functionality I would even want to add.

I am open to ideas and of course welcome forks, though!
