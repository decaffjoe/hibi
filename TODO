- Page for yesterday's character (or past week?)
- Add voice actor information
    Ideally their take on the character as well
- Scale down for mobile
- Daily pipeline to fetch API info and update public/
    cron jobs for CI/CD?
- Light theme w/ switcher

FUTURE:
- Vote for character of the week?
- Group characters together to form your own cast?
